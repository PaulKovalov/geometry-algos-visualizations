## Geometry algorithms visualisations
Implementations of some geometry algorithms using SFML graphics library for visualizations.
To compile code, run `make`. Executable `main` will be generated, then run it using `./main`.

Requires installed SFML libraries, exact list of required libraries see in Makefile of the project which you want to compile
